        <p class="about_text">
            
            <br /> AARAMBH HOSPITALITY SERVICES (AHS) Est.2019 (ISO 9001:2015 ) is a leading hospitality service provider committed to delivering exceptional experiences.
            <br />
            <br />Our commitment to excellence and spirit of progress has resulted in the successful provision of over 5 million meals annually and counting more every year. We continuously adapt our services to meet the unique needs of our clients by conducting market research and offering solutions. In 2019, we established a cutting-edge central kitchen in Mahim, which enabled us to secure our first contract with m/s. Oldendroff. Building on this success, we booked a contract with Ernst & Young and later with Grasim Industries in July 2020. Our previous professional experience with Grasim Industries played a significant role in securing this contract, which allowed us to serve 9,000 meals per day. In 2021, we expanded our services to include managing catering services and providing manpower supplies to Vedanta's office.
